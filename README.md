## ARP Poisoning Defender

This is a small script I have written in C to provide protection against malicious ARP attacks, changing the gateway's MAC Address in the ARP table of a victim's PC.

## How it works

The program saves the Gateway's MAC and IP Address when started. It then scans for every incoming ARP packet to see if it has the ARP Source of the gateway's ip. It blocks these packets (without a delay, like in other ARP defending scripts) using arptables, and instantly updates the ARP table to match the gateway's IP and MAC. It keeps the attacker's MAC address blocked for receiving ARP packets for 5 minutes. When the program exists, it allows all MAC addresses to send ARP packets again (to the PC running the script), as well as flushing the ARP table.

## Cross Platform
For now, the script only works on linux. I will try to release a win64 version ASAP.

## Installation and build
ARPPD needs arptables to run, so just install it:
```
sudo apt-get install arptables
```

There's a pre-built executable in the builds folder, or build it yourself:

To build:
* Run `compile_arppd_linux`

OR

* Go in the main directory
* Run:
```
gcc -o builds/defender-win64 src-win64/defender.c -lpcap -pthread
```

## Malicious ARP Packets
When the ARPPD will detect a malicious ARP Packet, it will look like this:
